# Klipper Configs

These configs are pretty similar to some of the examples in the offical [Klipper repo](https://github.com/KevinOConnor/klipper), and they're pretty customized, but I thought it would be both safe for me in the event I catastrophically misplace them, and hopefully convenient and useful for anyone out there muddling through their first Klipper configs.
